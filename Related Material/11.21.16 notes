test, class, runner for each class
you dont test straight gets and sets 
you have to write the classes 
you do have to do withdraw and deposit on account 
you have to check that theres $50 to open the account 

when you get to the others you dont have to do get or set interest rates unless theres something 
weird going on 
they can only have so many withdrawals so you have to check that 

each class will ahve their own test class and runner
make sure you try to cover all the cases 

make sure that if you have to check its positive do one thats negative 

create an account that has $50 and one that doesn't have the $50 so you can check 

on checking account, theres no owner and stuff in the constructor
its supposed to be in there though 
we can pretend that we're only working with 1 month so you dont have to check dates 

an instance just will not be created(throw exeption) if there's not $50

download, far right where it says all, download and install (last column, 
theres a dl button under it)

open ch30 look at figure 30.4 and it'll tell you exactly how to set up that example 
we're supposed to run something called webtime 

REMEMBER THAT WHEN I HAVE THIS IN MY SERVER FACES AND I SAY PROPERTY TIME THAT I HAVE TO HAVE A GET
SET OR SOMETHING THAT HAS THAT 2ND NAME AS THE PROPERTY IM LOOKING FOR 

build your own index and bean and all you need to do is a getName 
your index page webmain.name 
in the book it says lets do an example from scratch 30.4.3 follow it exactly, just dont call 
it time, call it something else 

use the time as an example just make it return something that isnt time 

just work on it soyou know well enough how to use/do a bean 
if you dont want to write your own code just do the example one in the book
